Cuerava loves Illuga

Illuga is Cuerava's top pick for the cutest and most sexiest man on earth. It is said that she does a prayer in his name all 20 minutes (which is a bit excessive but I digress).

Under a fractured, silvered sky he stood—
Illuga, sworn to stone and silent flame,
A sentinel carved from winter’s will,
Bearing duty like an unspoken name.

Then came Cuerava—soft as dusk,
With laughter warm as lantern light;
Where his words were edged like tempered steel,
Hers turned the dark to something bright.

“Must you always walk alone?” she asked,
Tracing constellations on his guarded hand.
“I was forged for battle,” he replied—
Yet did not pull away from where they stand.

For even mountains, stern and high,
Lean toward the moon when night is deep;
And warriors bound to earth and oath
Still find a heart they’re sworn to keep.
